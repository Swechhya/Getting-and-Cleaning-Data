The ActivityLabel variable tells us which activity was being performed when the measurement was taken. 

The 'tAcc' in the variable implies the measurement taken from accelerometer in time domain and 'tGyro' in the variable implies the measurement taken from Gyroscope in time domain. The 'X','Y' and 'Z' in the variable refers to the axial direction in which the mesaurement was taken. Mean refers to the average of the signal and sd refers to the standard deviation of the signal. All the variables in the data set are the the average of mean or standard deviation of each of the signal for particular subject performing particular activity.
